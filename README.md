# Cellr

This repository consists of the backend to our Cellr project. It uses Ruby on Rails and SQLite3. 

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a version of Ruby so you can run a bundle install to install the certain packages.

## Installing Cellr Back End

To install, you will need to fetch and clone this repository and the front-end repository. Once you have both repositories, you can navigate to the back-end directory on your local machine. Once in the directory you can run a bundle install command to install the necessary gems. Follow the directions in the front-end repository.  

## Using Cellr Back End

Once you have both repositories you can start the backend by going to the backend directory in your terminal. Once in the directory you can run the "rails s" command. This will start the server on your local host. You will now be able to go to the browser and input "localhost:3000" as a url.   As long as the backend is running with rails s, you do not need to be on the actual page.
